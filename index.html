                Currently in my third year of B.Ed IT at Samtse College of Education. <br>
                Teaching has always been my dream, inspired not only by my own ambitions, 
                but also by my parents’ aspirations. <br>
                I love how children’s questions push us to think differently and 
                keep me a lifelong learner.
                My journey from Arts in high school to ICT in college has taught me resilience and adaptability. 
                I believe teaching is not just about imparting knowledge, but about nurturing curiosity and kindness. 
                My dream is to create engaging, technology-rich classrooms that empower future generations.

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Physics Project: PN Junction Diode</h3>
      <img src="Earthquake Detector.jpg" alt="Picture of Earthquake Detector" class="project-img">
      <p>As part of a group project in Physics, we developed an Earthquake Detector using a simple 
        transistor-based circuit that made lights turn on and off alternately when vibrations were detected. 
        Working together, we designed and assembled the circuit using transistors, resistors, and LEDs to 
        simulate an early-warning system. This project gave us hands-on experience with circuit design, 
        teamwork, and practical application of transistors as switches and amplifiers, while also showing how
         basic electronics can be applied to create cost-effective safety devices for real-life situations.</p>

    <!-- Project 2 -->
    <div class="project">
      <h3>DDD Project: E-commerce and Online Shopping System</h3>
      <img src="E-commerce.jpg" alt="Image of E-commerce" class="project-img">
      <p>I developed an E-Commerce and Online Shopping System using MySQL, incorporating features such as 
        customer management, product catalog, shopping cart, and order tracking. The project gave me practical 
        experience in database design, normalization, and ER modeling, along with implementing CRUD operations, 
        SQL joins, and stored procedures for efficient data handling. I also designed relational tables to 
        manage customer profiles, inventory, transactions, and order histories, which helped me strengthen my
         skills in query optimization, data integrity, and real-world application of database systems.</p>

      <h3>Future Project: College Club and Event</h3>
      <img src="College Club.jpg" alt="Image of College Club" class="project-img">
      <p>We are planning to develop a digital platform for the Samtse College of Education (SCE) that
         will allow students and staff to register online and stay updated with important information. 
         The platform will act as a central hub for communication, where users can easily access announcements, 
         events, schedules, and other academic or administrative updates. By digitizing these services, 
         the system aims to reduce paperwork, save time, and enhance accessibility, ensuring a more efficient, 
         transparent, and user-friendly experience for the SCE community.</p>
